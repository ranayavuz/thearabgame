this is a manual for running game.py, lets get started

1. install python (3.10+) using self service or the website

2. open terminal and type this command:

pip3 install colorama

3. keep the terminal open type this with a space at the end

python3

4. but dont run it yet, drag your downloaded file to the terminal and then run it (press enter)

and ignore __pycache__, as it is python's binary files to help with importing the config

#configuration

make sure to open config.py, and NEVER CHANGE THE VARIABLE NAMES!!!

black_terminal is just something where you can specify if your terminal's background is black or not, simply put in True or False

mode is just to set the game's difficulty. these are all values:

"baby"

"easy"

"normal"

"hard"

"dragon"

more config coming soon!
